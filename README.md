# Face Landmark Detection and Visualization

This project is an iOS application that uses Apple's Vision Framework to detect facial landmarks in real-time video from the camera. The app processes frames, identifies facial landmarks, and visualizes them on the screen with numbers and a bounding box around the detected face.

## Features
- Real-time face detection using `VNDetectFaceLandmarksRequest`.
- Draws circles for facial landmarks and labels them with numbers.
- Displays a bounding box around the detected face.

## Known Issue
- **Landmark Alignment**: The current implementation does not perfectly align the landmarks to the detected face. The drawing has minor inaccuracies and does not fully fit the face geometry, especially when the face is rotated or angled.

## Requirements
- iOS 14.0 or later.
- Xcode 14 or later.
- A device with a camera (e.g., iPhone or iPad).

## Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-landmark-detection.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open FaceLandmarkDetection.xcodeproj
   ```
3. Ensure your development device is connected.
4. Build and run the app on your device.

## How It Works
1. The app uses `AVFoundation` to capture video frames from the camera.
2. Each frame is processed with `VNImageRequestHandler` and `VNDetectFaceLandmarksRequest` from the Vision Framework.
3. Detected landmarks are:
   - Rotated by 90 degrees clockwise.
   - Drawn as green circles on the screen.
   - Annotated with numbers corresponding to the landmark indices.
4. A red bounding box outlines the detected face.

## Code Highlights
- **Face Detection**:
  ```swift
  let request = VNDetectFaceLandmarksRequest { (request, error) in
      if let observations = request.results as? [VNFaceObservation] {
          DispatchQueue.main.async {
              for face in observations {
                  self.highlightPoints(on: face)
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```

- **Landmark Visualization**:
  ```swift
  let rotatedPoint = CGPoint(
      x: faceRect.origin.x + (1 - point.y) * faceRect.width,
      y: faceRect.origin.y + point.x * faceRect.height
  )
  ```

- **Bounding Box**:
  ```swift
  let boundingBoxPath = UIBezierPath(rect: faceRect)
  boundingBoxLayer.path = boundingBoxPath.cgPath
  ```

## Known Limitations
1. The alignment of landmarks to the face needs improvement.
2. Accuracy is limited by the Vision Framework's capabilities for extreme angles or partially obscured faces.

## Future Improvements
- Improve landmark alignment to better fit the detected face.
- Implement 3D face tracking for better accuracy and usability.
- Add support for dynamic orientation adjustments.
